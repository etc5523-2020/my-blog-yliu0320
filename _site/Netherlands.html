<p>Thank the coronavirus repository<span class="citation">(RamiKrispin 2020)</span> for providing the raw data.</p>
<p>Now I use some essential functions in R to do a brief analysis about Netherlands coronavirus data.It helps people to have a better data visualisation.</p>
<p>The table below shows the total number of infected, deaths and recovered in Netherlands from 2020.01.22 to 2020.08.29.</p>
<table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<caption>

<p><br> In the following table, it even helps people to clearly know the daily confirmed,death and recovered data.Also this interactive table allows people to sort data in order.It is so amazing.</p>

<p>The tables and plot above display the overall data and trend in Netherlands.The contingency table below displays a detailed data information about the death proportion due to the coronavirus grouping by age and gender.Maybe people would find an interesting data story in the description below.</p>
<p>These numerical summary statistics show the distribution of the death toll,which fits with people’s common sense to some extent.From the table,it is easy to find that most deaths occurred in older patients,and roughly more than 88% deaths occurred in patients aged 70 years old and over.However, the proportion of people who are under 50 years old died from the coronavirus is very low just about 0.74%<span class="citation">(statista 2020)</span>.These data indicate that the elder have a bad immunity.</p>
<p>But people would also notice that the death proportion of male is higher than that of female<span class="citation">(GlobalHealth50/50 2020)</span>.Maybe it violates our common sense.Most of people consider male has a better physical fitness than female.But from the data shown in the table,it is opposite.</p>
